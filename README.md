#Preprocessing of Data for Machine Learning
First, I checked the dataset for spelling errors and confirmed that there are no null values. Then, I addressed the columns with the data type "object." Specifically, the following columns were identified:
Gender
Field_of_Study
Current_Job_Level
Entrepreneurship

I transformed the data types as follows:
For Gender, Current_Job_Level, and Entrepreneurship, I mapped the categorical values to integer values.
For Field_of_Study, I used fit_transform to encode the categorical values as integers.

After these changes, all columns in the dataset now have either integer or float data types. The dataset is now ready for machine learning.
